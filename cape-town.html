        <h2>Best places to be in Cape Town</h2>
        <div class="gallery">
        <h3>Muizen_Beach</h3>

        </div>
        <p>Muizenberg Beach is a coastal suburb of Cape Town. The sandy beach isn’t very long, but the water is warmer to swim in than other Cape Beaches. Its biggest attraction, however, may be the waves that make it popular with surfers; it is where surfing began in South Africa. Muizenberg Beach is a good place to learn this water sport, with lessons readily available. The area fell into disrepair in the late 20th century, but is now pulling itself back up to its former splendor. Non-beach attractions include the house that Cecil Rhodes built and where he died in 1902.</p>

        <h3>Robben Island</h3>

        <p>Located just off the coast of Cape Town, Robben Island is not a place to go if visitors are looking only for a good time. Over a span of three centuries, Robben Island was used as a military base, a hospital for those with socially unacceptable diseases such as lepers and as a prison for political prisoners. Its most famous prisoner was undoubtedly Nelson Mandela, who was imprisoned here for 18 years; he went on to become president of South Africa following his release. Today Robben Island is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Cape Town and can be reached by ferry from the V&A Waterfront.</p>
        <br/><br/>
        <h3>Victoria and Alfred Waterfront</h3>
        <img src="images/victoria_and_alfred_waterfront.jpg"/>
        <p>The Victoria & Alfred Waterfront is considered one of South Africa’s most popular attractions, with its stunning views of the Atlantic Ocean, Table Bay and Table Mountain. Named for the British Queen Victoria and her youngest son Alfred, who tipped the first stones for the breakwater back in the 1860s, the historic waterfront today boasts a variety of shops, restaurants and nightlife. The waterfront also is home to art galleries, an aquarium, an amphitheater with live entertainment that is usually free, and a ship museum, among other attractions.</p>
        <br/><br/>
        <h3>Table Mountain</h3>
        <img src="images/table_mountain.jpg"/>
        <p>Situated within a national park, reaching the pinnacle of the Table Mountain is an thrilling experience that offers phenomenal, birds-eye views overlooking the city of Cape Town, Robben Island to the north, and the Atlantic seaboard to the west and south. Peaking at 1,086 meters (3,563 ft), the top can easily be reached via an ingenuous cableway, and each Rotair car features revolving floors allowing passengers to enjoy 360-degree views during the trek to the top.</p>
        <br/><br/>
        <h3>Boulders Beach Penguin Colony</h3>
        <img src="images/boulders_beach_penguin_colony.jpg"/>
        <p>There aren’t too many places in the world where one can walk on the beach, sunbathe or swim with penguins as companions, but Boulders Beach is one of them. Two penguins settled on this beach, an hour’s drive from Cape Town, in 1982. Now more than 2,000 penguins call this beach home. These are African penguins, sometimes called “jackass” penguins because their chirps sound more like a donkey’s bray than a bird tweet. The path to the penguin area is wheel-chair accessible and allows visitors to get within a few feet of the penguins. While the penguins are used to humans, visitors should look, but not touch them, as they may bite if they get scared.</p>
