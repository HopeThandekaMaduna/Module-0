        </div>
        <p>A good starting point for a walking tour of Durban is the "Golden Mile." This bustling beachfront promenade is lined with high-rise hotels, entertainment complexes, shops, and restaurants. The broad, golden beaches are a magnet for water sports enthusiasts who come here to surf, swim, fish, or just bask in the sunshine. Lifeguards and shark nets protect most of the beaches year-round.

            Along the busy oceanfront path, pedestrians jostle with joggers, cyclists, Segways, and skateboarders, making the area feel a little like California. Other highlights along this coastal stretch include uShaka Marine World; Moses Mabhida Stadium; and Mini Town, a pint-sized replica of Durban, complete with a miniature rail network, airport, and harbor scene.</p>

        <p>In the Riverside district, on the north bank of the Umgeni River, Umgeni River Bird Park features more than 200 species of birds, and some are the only representatives of their kind in Africa. On a network of paths running through lush landscaping and waterfalls, visitors can observe a variety of indigenous species, as well as birds from Southeast Asia and Australia, including lories, cockatoos, and aras. One of the highlights of the park is the bird show, where visitors can learn more about the exotic species as they perform.
