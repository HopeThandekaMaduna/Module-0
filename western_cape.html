        </div>
        <p>Located at the southernmost tip of the continent, where the Atlantic and Indian Oceans dramatically meet at the Cape of Storms, Agulhas National Park is a fascinating place to visit. Over the centuries, numerous ships and sailors have met their fate along its unwelcoming, rugged coastline.

            Humans have long inhabited the area, and while exploring the park, visitors can check out the old lighthouse and museum, which house part of shipwrecks and ancient stone utensils once used by the Khoisan people.
            
            With lots of marine, mammal, and birdlife also on show, the national park is delightful to hike around; wherever you go, the scenery is absolutely stunning. With dolphins, whales, and porpoises sometimes spotted offshore, Agulhas National Park is definitely worth visiting if you have the chance.</p>
